Free source code for SuperVGA Graphics
--------------------------------------

The SciTech SuperVGA Kit is a library of freely available source code showing
how to properly interface to the VBE 1.2, VBE 2.0 and VBE/AF interface
standards. Although

Not a supported product!
------------------------

Although the previous release of the SciTech SuperVGA Kit was a product
supported by SciTech Software, this release is freeware with no support.
All of the functionality of the SuperVGA Kit is available (along with a
compatibility library) in the new SciTech MGL 3.0 graphics library, so if
you are doing serious development you will probably want to check this
library out instead. The SciTech MGL 3.0 libraries provide a complete
set of drawing primitives, and any source code developed with the MGL API
is fully portable to Windows. On top of that the SciTech MGL libraries
have complete support for SciTech WinDirect as well as Microsoft DirectDraw.
You can download evaluation versions of the SciTech MGL from:

MGL 3.0 for DOS:

 ftp://ftp.scitechsoft.com/mgld30.exe

MGL 3.0 for Windows:

 ftp://ftp.scitechsoft.com/mglw30.exe

Source code only - no libraries provided
----------------------------------------

Note that this archive is source code only, and does not come with any
pre-build libraries. If you require pre-built libraries, the MGL 3.0 release
comes with pre-built libraries for the SuperVGA Kit and complete reference
documentation for existing SuperVGA Kit users.
