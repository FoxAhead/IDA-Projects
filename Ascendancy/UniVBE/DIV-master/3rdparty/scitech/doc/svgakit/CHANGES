					Log of changes for the SuperVGA Kit
					-----------------------------------

Version 6.0 (April 1996)

    - Added support for VBE/AF Accelerator Functions. The library API changed
      somewhat to provide a common interface to both the standard VBE and
      VBE/AF services, so code using the SuperVGA Kit can work on either
      devices without any changes to the code.

    - Added support for building the SuperVGA Kit as both 16 and 32 bit
      DLL's under Windows. This required changing the API to move all global
      variables out of the library and into a global structure which is
      passed back to the application.

    - Added WinDirect, PM/Pro and Zen Timer libraries to the SuperVGA Kit
      installation for DOS and Windows.

    - Added new support for the WinDirect DOS compatability library, which
      provides DOS applications with an indentical interface to the
      WinDirect fullscreen event handling interface for Windows.

    - Updated the code to correctly pass the memory mapped IO selector to
	  the VBE 2.0 display start address and palette programming routines.

	- Changed palette setting code to automatically do conversion from 8
	  bits per primary format to the 6 or 8 bit format used by the
	  hardware palette if necessary. VBE/AF always takes data in 8 bit
	  format, so this makes is standard across the library.

	- Changed bank switched functions to not require the active display
	  page to start on a 64Kb boundary, but can now start anywhere in
	  video memory (required by VBE/AF).

    - Changed names of WinDirect and PM/Pro DLL's to include the SuperVGA
      Kit version number to avoid versioning problems in the field.

    - Fixed bug in WinDirect 16 bit mouse coordinate scaling code to
      return coorect coordinates.

    - Fixed bug in WinDirect Alt-Tab code under Win95 causing the main
      WinDirect window to lose the keyboard focus when restored.

    - Fixed Win95 WinDirect support to allow the application to stop users
      from Alt-Tab'ing away from the WinDirect app back to the desktop.

    - Fixed minor bugs in WinDirect event handling code for Windows (control
      keys not mapping).

    - Added new flat thunking code for Win95 support. Should no longer need
      to set the executeable type to Win31 for 32 bit apps.

Version 5.2 (September 1995)

	- Added support for VBE 2.0 bank switched devices that use memory mapped
	  IO exclusively for bank switching according to the draft VBE 2.0
	  clarifications. Some new SuperVGA devices require this to function
	  properly with VBE 2.0.

	- Added new virtual linear framebuffer emulation technology (code in
      PM/Pro library) for DOS.

    - Added code to map all video memory locations (both banked and hardware
      linear buffers) into near memory, so no selectors are ever used to
      access video memory anymore.

    - Moved WinDirect support into a separate package.

Version 5.1 (February 5 1995)

    - Added new WinDirect technology and new SuperVGA Kit for Windows
      test program.

    - Added new hybrid 16/32 bit technology for running full 32 bit
      protected mode code from 16 bit Windows apps. This allows 16 bit
      protected mode Windows apps to call the VBE 2.0 protected mode
      functions directly, and to run code to program a linear framebuffer
      directly without needing Win32s.

    - Added support for VBE 2.0 32 bit protected mode interface.

    - Added support for VBE 2.0 linear framebuffer's.

Version 5.0 (August 22 1994)

	- Combined all test programs into a single test program to conserve
	  on compiled code size.

	- Added highly optimised assembly language line drawing routines for
	  each color mode.

	- Added support for 32 bits per pixel 16 million color modes.

    - Ported to 32 bit protected mode for supported compilers.

    - Added support for the new high speed protected mode interface in
      UniVBE 5.0 for 32 bit protected mode.

    - Added PROFILE.EXE performance profiling program.

    - Added HELLOVBE.C hello world program for VBE programming.

    - Renamed PARANOID.EXE to VBETEST.EXE.

	- Added code to ensure log file is flushed to disk after each
	  entry to aid in the debugging process in case VBETest causes a crash.

Version 4.3 (20 March 1994)

    - Added support for 16 and 32 bit protected mode.

    - Enhanced reporting facilities and testing functions in PARANOID.

Version 4.2 (22 Oct 1993)

    - Shareware release of Universal VESA VBE, so source code was removed
      from this archive.

    - Added support for a few more advanced features of the VESA VBE.

    - Fixed the library so that it now works in any video mode without
      requiring the user program to set up any variables.

Version 4.0 (18 Sep 1993)

    - Added support for Microsoft C to the library. Now there is both a
      Borland and MSC version of the library.

    - Added support for the Universal VESA VBE's protected mode programming
      interface to the code.

    - The Universal VESA VBE is now completely separate to this package,
      although they are distributed in the same archive.

	- The entire SuperVGA kit has been re-written to work only with
	  VESA VBE 1.2 or above compliant SuperVGA's (such as the Universal
	  VESA VBE) and much of the code has been converted into C for
	  readability and portability. Low level drawing code is still in
	  assembler for speed.

Version 3.2 (25 March 1993)

    - Fixed problems with the Universal VESA TSR not correctly calculating
      the total number of scanlines in video memory.

    - More bug fixes for troublesome chipsets.

    - Fixed problems with optional mode information (again) so that the
      32k and 16m color video modes now work correctly.

    - Added support for correct memory size determination for VESA version
      1.2 and above. Also added support for this to the detectgr.asm module,
      rather than using the horrible video mode hack to determine the size.

    - Added support for 64k color modes. I had hoped not to do this, but
      it seems a lot of video boards provide 64k but not 32k color modes.
      It is also not possible to use 64k modes as pseudo 32k modes as
      the bitmap layouts for the modes are different.

    - Enhanced the support for the S3, by adding support for the HiColor
      and TrueColor modes of the 801/805 and 928 cards.

    - Fixed bank switching and extended page flipping to be able to
      correctly access up to 4Mb on the S3 801/805 and 928 based card

Version 3.1 (7 March 1993)

    - Changed the Universal VESA TSR to compile in the large memory model,
      and to startup in C to perform the SuperVGA detection etc. Thus it
      now also takes command line arguments to force it to work with any
      SuperVGA configuration. It can now also be compiled in testing mode
      where it will call a C testing procedure after installing the interrupt
      handlers so it can be debugged easily using Turbo Debugger. It will
      not go TSR when in testing mode, but simply restore the interrupt
      vectors and quit.

    - Added support for returning optional mode information to the
      Universal VESA TSR to make it more compatible.

    - Fixed bugs in the detection of TrueColor video DAC's.

    - Change the version numbering for the Universal VESA TSR to match
      the SuperVGA test kit library.

    - Added command line options to the programs to allow the
      programs to be forced to run for a particular video card. This
      includes the Universal VESA TSR.

    - Added code to both the test programs and Univesal VESA TSR to
      check the type of CPU before running the program.

    - Fixed problems with clearing unavailable 24 bit video modes for
      Genoa 7900 and Speedstar 24 cards. This should work now.

    - Added code to detect whether the 1280x1024x16 color video mode
      is available on ET4000 cards (older ones don't have it).

    - Fixed problem with detecting 32k and 16m color support on Everex
      Viewpoint TC card. Also fixed problem with not correctly calculating
      the number of pages on Everex boards.

    - Fixed problem with detecting the number of pages on Cirrus 5422
      boards.

    - Attempted to fix problem with extended flipping of Standard VGA
      modes on Ahead SuperVGA's.

Version 3.0 (30 Feb 1993)

    - Added the Universal VESA TSR. This will provide full VESA 1.2 BIOS
      functionality for all supported SuperVGA's.

    - Restructured the test kit code into test programs and an underlying
      'C' callable library for each video mode type (16, 256, 32k and
      16m colors). Thus you can now easily use the library code in your
      own programs.

    - Fixed bugs with the Paradise WD90C30 video card.

    - Add a number of hacks to the ET4000 code to make it work with all the
      different 24 bit cards that have different mode numbers (MegaEva/2,
      Diamond Speedstar 24, Genoa 7900).

Version 2.1 (24 Feb 1993)

    - The library is now '386 specific, given the incredibly cheap
      price of '386 hardware (and the benefits obtained).

    - Added support for all the standard EGA and VGA modes as well, so
      you can test page flipping etc for all possible video modes.

    - Better support for calculating the number of available pages, so
      will work out correct number of pages for adpaters with > 1Mb on
      board.

    - Add support to determine the number of available pages for a
      video mode during video adapter detection.

    - Restructured the entire library to help in the development of the
      Universal VESA TSR program. The framework has now been laid for
      this project to progress.

    - Added detection of available video pages for a specific mode
      before the mode is actually set.

    - Removed memcheck from VESA detection routine. This does not seem to
      work correctly on all VESA boards. If the VESA BIOS gives incorrect
      memory values by not restricting video modes depending on the available
      memory, we can do nothing about it.

    - Fixed up S3 support to only use the VESA 10xh video modes, and not the
      20xh co-processed video modes, to ensure compatibility.

    - Removed all support for the S3 1280x1024x16 color video mode. This
      is such a silly mode that it is not worth supporting...

    - Fixed bugs in a number of video adapter routines.

Version 2.0 (28 Nov 1992)

    - Modified code to be '286 processor dependant, for extra speed.
      Who uses XT's for real Graphics anyway?

    - Fixed bug in Trident 8900 page flipping code.

    - Fixed bug in Paradise initialisation testing code.

    - Fixed bug in numbering of VESA 32k video modes.

    - Added a number of modules and include files to define the video
      mode numbers supported by each particular video card.

    - Added tables of symbolic video mode and driver names.

    - Restructured the test programs to work with any of the supported
      video modes, and to provide more useful information about whether
      the test has succeeded or not.

    - Added both 32k color and 16 million color test programs.

    - Modified the mode setting code to remember if the EGA/VGA 43 line
      mode was set, and to reset it when graphics mode is exited if it
      was.

    - Removed old write bank setting routines. Now you simply call
      [NewBank] to set both the read/write banks, and [ReadBank] to
      change the read bank to some other value.

    - Added support for VESA SuperVGA extended page flipping!

    - Detection of VESA SuperVGA's can be done either before or after
      detection of all supported SuperVGA's.

    - Added support for separate read/write banks and extended page
      flipping for more boards.

    - Added support for more SuperVGA's (AL2101, MXIC, Primus 2000,
      RealTek 3106).

    - Improved SuperVGA detection code by making the tests for each
      video card a lot more stringent, to avoid misidentifications. Also
      each routine will modify the list of available modes depending
      on the installed chip version.

    - Added support for detecting the type of Video DAC installed, for
      both HiColor (15 bit) and TrueColor (24 bit) type DAC's.

    - Added support for wierd boards like the S3, which have large
      bytes per line values.

    - Added support for the Oak Tech OTI-037C SuperVGA (only has
      800x600x16 color mode tho).

    - Fixed a number of bugs in the Trident 8900 code. Should work well now.

Version 1.1 (19 Nov 92)

    - Added memory detect routine for VESA compatible SuperVGA's.

    - Saving the BytesPerLine value for VESA compatible SuperVGA's, and
      better handling of VESA Video Mode numbers in MGL_detectGraph().

    - Support for VESA 1.2 video modes (up to 1280x1024 16 million colors)

    - Added support for AcuMos SuperVGA detection and bank switching

    - Added support for S3 based SuperVGA's bank switching (missing
      from previous release) and extended page flipping. Also added
      checking for S3 HiColor video mode availability.

    - Added support for detection of newer ATI SuperVGA chips that
      support up to 1M of video ram.

    - Fixed bug in bank switching code for Video7 V7VGA Version 5
      chipsets (I think this is what the Video7 1024i has).

    - Added code to differentiate between C&T 82C451/452/453 chips
      as bank switching is different for each chip.

    - Fixed bug in Tseng ET3000 bank switching code causing it not to
      work in 256 color modes.

    - Added enhanced memory size detection for Everex video boards

    - Added support for separate read/write banks and extended page
      flipping for Ahead B SuperVGA's

    - Modified to check for HiColor DAC internally in MGL_detectGraph,
      adjusting the list of available modes accordingly. Thus we no
      longer have the grSVGA_ET4000HC et al device numbers.

Version 1.0 - First public release (14 Nov 92)
