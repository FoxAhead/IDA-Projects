                ------------------------------------------

Utilities in this package
-------------------------

These three utilities are very simple but help to simplify our makefiles.
We use them all the time and the makefile in the archive that these
files came in use these utilties. They must be placed in the path or in
the current directory that you are executing make in.

FOREACH: Simply performs a command on a number of files, where the files
are specified in a list. This list can be manually created or can be
passed directly to it via a temporary file in DMAKE.

DJ_LD: Takes a set of command line parameters to be passed on to the DJGPP
port of GNU C/C++ and compiles and links the code directly into a bounds .exe
file that can be run directly. The DJGPP port has no command line option
to do this automatically, so this provides that intermediate step.

TRIMLIB: Takes a linker response file for Watcom C++ 10.0, and will trim
out any empty LIBR statements (unfortunately we have not worked out how
to get DMAKE to automatically trim these).

MAKEDEP: Makefile dependency generator program, that will take a list of
object files and search file all the related source files and build the
dependencies lists for them. This allows the dependency tracking to be
handled automatically from the makefiles and can be updated simply with
a 'make depend'.

RCLINK: Takes the name of the linker and resource compiler and compile
definition files containing compile switches, objects files and the .res
file to be linked. It then strips out the .res file from the object file
list, passes all the object files to be linked by the linker and then
runs the resouce compiler on the .res file and .exe file to bind the
resources to the completed .exe file. This utility allows a single
line to be used to define all the object files and resource file to be
used when compiling a Windows executable, which simplifies our makefiles.

GNU Utilities
-------------

A number of pre-compiled GNU utilities are provided in the makefile utilities
archives. You can obtain the full source code to these from the internet
Simtel-20 archive oak.oakland.edu in the pub\gnuish\futi*.zip archives.
All of these utilities are covered by the GNU General Public License
contained in the file COPYING in this directory. The following is a list
of the GNU utilities included in this archive:

RM.EXE  - Unix like file ReMove utility
CP.EXE  - Unix like file CoPy utility
MV.EXE  - Unix like file MoVe utility

DMAKE 3.8
---------

This distribution also contains the executable for DMAKE 3.8. This very
powerful version of the Unix MAKE is cross platform portable, and freely
distributable under the GNU General Public License (see the file COPYING
contained in this directory). We chose this version of MAKE to be our
cross platform, cross compiler portable version of MAKE, since it allows
one to change the standard behaviour with MAKE startup files (which forms
the core of the SciTech Common Makefile Utilities Package). We have included
for your reference the file DMAKE.MAN, which contains the ASCII text version
of the manual pages for this program. You can get the official distribution
archive from oak.oakland.edu int pub\msdos\c\dmake38e.zip archive, and the
full source code is available in the pub\msdos\c\dmake38s.zip archive.

If you wish to obtain the source code to any of the GNU utilities or the
DMAKE program, contact us directly and we will forward your a copy of
the source code providing you pay for the shipping charges.
