              Log of changes for the PM/Lite and PM/Pro Libraries
              ---------------------------------------------------

Version 2.3 (April 1996)

    - Improved performance of the Virtual Flat Linear Framebuffer exception
      handler.

	- Updated to support the CauseWay DOS extender including virtual
	  linear framebuffer support.

Version 2.2 (September 1995)

    - First release of PM/Pro interrupt handling code.

    - Added support for virtual linear framebuffer emulation routines
      for DOS4GW, PMODE/W and FlashTek X32.

    - Added support for creating near pointers to physical memory that
      is fully DPMI compliant.

    - Added support for obtaining physical and virtual memory information
      at program startup.

Version 2.1 (March 1995)

    - Fixed bug in PM_int386() introduced into version 2.0

    - Added support for mapping VGA framebuffer and linear framebuffer's
      into near address space for maximum performance.

Version 2.0 (6 February 1995)

    - Added support for X-32VM with Symantec C++ and Watcom C++.

    - Added support for Visual C++ with Phar Lap TNT.

    - Added PM_int386(), PM_int386x() and PM_segread() routines for
      generating protected mode interrupts that are compiler portable
      (all compilers tend to implement this slightly different in 32 bit PM).

    - Built generic set of 32 bit DPMI routines that work across all DPMI
      compatible DOS extenders, significantly simplifying the underlying
      code (PM_int386() makes this possible).

    - Added support for mapping physical memory locations above 1Mb
      (SuperVGA linear framebuffers).

    - Added support for Windows DPMI programming for real Windows apps.

Version 1.0 (22 August 1994)

    - First release of PM/Lite library
