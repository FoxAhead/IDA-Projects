     Product Information
     -------------------

     MegaToolbox (MTL)

          The MegaToolbox is a set of four separate function libraries
          for C and C++ programming environments under the MS-DOS
          operating system. The separate libraries that make up the
          MegaToolbox are:

             Console library. This provides a number of routines for
             interfacing to the video display in standard text mode. It
             provides the functionality of the standard C output
             routines, but can be configured to send the output to the
             display in any of the available colors, and the output can
             be mapped and clipped to any rectangular window on the
             screen. The routines are similar in operation to the set of
             console output routines provided with the Borland C++ and
             Turbo C++ range of compilers, but they are faster and more
             configurable.

             Event handling library. This library provides a set of low
             level routines to maintain a queue of keyboard and mouse
             events. Naturally the events are not restricted to just
             keyboard and mouse events, but can be any type of user
             defined event. This allows the program to easily combine
             the keyboard and mouse into a single system for interacting
             with the user.

             Mouse library. This library provides a high level language
             interface to the mouse driver, allowing the user program to
             fully control the mouse and to install a custom mouse event
             handler. Full control of the mouse in both text and
             graphics modes is provided.

             Sysinfo library. This library provides a set of diagnostic
             routines that can be called upon to identify the type of
             computer system that a program is running on. It can
             automatically determine things such as the processor type
             (8086 - 80486), BIOS class, extended keyboard support,
             video display subsystem type and so on.

          The MegaToolbox supports the Borland C++, Microsoft C and
          Symantec C++ range of compilers in 16 bit real mode (32 bit
          protected mode support for Symantec C++ and Watcom C/C++ will
          be available soon, and may well be available by the time you
          read this).

     MegaGraph Graphics Library (MGL)

          The MegaGraph Graphics Library (MGL) is a full featured
          graphics library for displaying high performance graphics on
          personal computers. It provides fast, low level 2D drawing
          primitives that can be used to implement video games, user
          interface software and even real-time 3D animation. It will
          work in any video mode that has 16 or more colors, including
          the new HiColor and TrueColor modes available on PC's.

          The MGL will also take advantage of certain PC based Windows

     SciTech Software Product Information                        Page: 4

          Accelerators for better performance in certain areas.

          Currently the MGL only works in 16 bit real mode with either
          Borland C++, Microsoft C and Symantec C++ however work is
          progressing on the 32 bit protected mode versions of the
          library.

     MGL 2D Extensions (MGL2D)

          The MGL 2D extensions library provides a fast floating
          point/fixed point two dimensional world coordinate system on
          top of the MGL. It provides full support for arbitrary 2D
          transformations such as translates, rotates, scales and
          shears. It provides 2D versions the MGL primitives such as
          pixels, lines, ellipses, polygons and even vector font text
          output (fully tranformed).

          It relies upon the Techniques Class Library to provide the
          transformation routines required to operate correctly, and is
          written in C++.

          Currently this product is only in the alpha testing stages and
          is not directly supported. You can obtain pre-release copies
          of the software with not documentation, and the MGL2D will
          eventually become a fully supported product.

     MGL 3D Extensions (MGL3D)

          The MGL 3D extensions library provides a fast floating
          point/fixed point three dimensional world coordinate system on
          top of the MGL. The MGL3D library is fast enough for doing
          real-time 3D polygonal animation, and the interface to the
          library is similar to that provided by the Silicon Graphics
          Iris GL library. It provides support for arbitrary 3D
          transformations such as translates, rotates, scales and
          shears. It provides 3D primitives such as pixels, lines,
          ellipses, polygons and even vector font text output (fully
          transformed).

          Currently the MGL3D does not provide direct support for hidden
          surface removal but support for software Z-buffering is being
          added to the low level MGL library to support this in the
          future. Presently a C++ BSP tree class is provided as an
          interim solution.

          It relies upon the Techniques Class Library to provide the
          tranformation routines required to operate correctly and is
          written in C++.

          Currently this product is only in the alpha testing stages and
          is not directly supported. You can obtain pre-release copies
          of the software with not documentation, and the MGL2D will
          eventually become a fully supported product.

     Techniques Class Library (TECH)

          The Techniques Class Library is high performance C++ class
          library for neatly implementing various data structures in
          C++. It uses the C++ template facility to provide type-safe

     SciTech Software Product Information                        Page: 5

          generic data structures. This library is used by all SciTech
          Software's C++ products.

          Currently this library is still under development and is
          distributed as copyrighted freeware with full source code and
          no documentation, and is not directly supported by SciTech
          Software. In the future this class library will become a
          supported SciTech Software product.

     MegaVision Application Frameworks (MVIS)

          The MegaVision Application Frameworks is a C++ based GUI
          toolkit for for the MegaGraph Graphics Library. It is similar
          in concept to Borland's Turbo Vision for DOS, but is still
          only partially developed. This library was used to build the
          MGL demo programs.

          Currently this library is still under development and is
          distributed as copyrighted freeware with full source code and
          no documentation, and is not directly supported by SciTech
          Software. There are no plans at this stage to make this a
          fully supported SciTech Software product.

     Universal VESA VBE

          The Universal VESA VBE is a small Terminate and Stay Resident
          program (TSR) for MSDOS that provides the VESA Video BIOS
          Extensions (VBE) for most SuperVGA cards on the market. It
          provides the latest VESA VBE standard so you can be sure your
          favorite programs will work correctly. Programs like Microsoft
          Flight Simulator 5 require that something like this be
          installed to obtain the highest performance possible.

          It also comes with a special 'paranoid' test program, for
          fully stress testing all VESA VBE interface implementations to
          ensure that they fully conform to the latest standards.

          The MGL works best with the UniVBE installed as it can take
          full advantage of the features on most SuperVGA video cards.

     Miscellaneous freeware

          The miscellaneous freeware disk contains a number of freely
          available tools developed by the people at SciTech Software
          over the years. They are supplied as is, without any warranty
          and are not supported, but come supplied with full source
          code. The tools included on the disk are:













     SciTech Software Product Information                        Page: 6

          SuperVGA Kit
          ------------

          A small set of test programs and libraries for programming
          SuperVGA cards in 16,256,32k,64k and 16 million color modes
          using the VESA VBE programming interface. Comes with a simple
          library showing how to interface with the VESA VBE from C and
          C++ programs. It also includes the full source code for the
          'paranoid' VESA VBE stress test program.

          C Tools
          -------

          A set of tools for working with data structures and other
          things in ANSI C. This library was written a long time ago and
          has since been converted in the Techniques Class Library
          described above. Useful if you still write code in ANSI C.

          Trans
          -----

          A fast text file translation program for converting text files
          between DOS and Unix formats and expanding tabs to spaces.
          Comes with makefiles to for both DOS and Unix environments.

          Makefile Utilities
          ------------------

          A number of simple utility programs for simplifying the work
          required to use the make program to create libraries and
          integrate with RCS. Works with Borland C++ make.

          The Zen Timer Library
          ---------------------

          This is a 'C' callable library for timing code fragments with
          an accuracy of better than 10 microseconds under the MSDOS
          operating system. The code was originally written by Michael
          Abrash for his book "Zen of Assembly language - Volume I,
          Knowledge" and was made into a 'C' callable library with a set
          of C++ wrapper classes.

          The PMODE Library
          -----------------

          This library provides a small DOS extender independant API for
          protected mode programming and covers all of the issues that
          usually burden the programmer converting their code to work
          with various DOS extenders (such as issuing real mode
          interrupts, allocating real mode memory, accessing the low 1Mb
          of real mode memory directly and installing protected mode
          interrupt handlers). All SciTech Software products use the
          PMODE library for providing support for DOS extenders, and all
          that is required to support a new DOS extender is to add
          support for this DOS extender to the PMODE Library. It fully
          supports real mode, 16 bit protected mode and 32 bit protected
          mode programming.
