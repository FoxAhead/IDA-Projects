Feature Requests:
1. Lock each window in the game interface.
One of the most annoying things is when you accidentally move (with the mouse) the main Game Window, or the Status Window, or the World Map window from their default positions. You then have to end up spending time unnecessarily placing them back in their original position. Would it be possible to have them "locked" to their original default positions?
2. Combine all music tracks from all Civ 2 games (Civ2 Classic, Civ2 Conflicts in Civilization, Civ2 Fantastic Worlds, Civ2 MGE, Civ2 Test of Time)
According to this site, there is no Civ2 game disc that contains all the tracks from all Civ2 games. You would have to insert the Fantastic Worlds disc, for example, if you want to hear soundtracks that are not listed in MGE.
I guess my question is, would it be possible to copy all tracks from all Civ2 games to a custom 'Music' folder (in something like MP3/FLAC/WAV format), and have the game play from this folder instead of from the disc?
As another feature request, since multiple users are having this same problem according to the threads, would it be possible to have this codec-enabling feature integrated directly in your Civ2UIA tweak? It would also prevent unnecessarily downloading other external third party programs (which may contain adware or such) just to enable this codec. Thank you sincerely.
[edit] Sorry, just wanted to add one more request. I notice the music track pauses when you access certain features like when consulting High Council or talking to other leaders. This is good. But once you return back to the game, instead of continuing where it left off, it moves to the next track. Would it be possible to have it continue from that point where it left off?
